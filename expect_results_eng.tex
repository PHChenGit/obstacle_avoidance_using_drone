	\section{Expected Result}
	We expect that employing the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) method will effectively enhance the obstacle avoidance capability of drones in static environments. By integrating perception and control, along with the DWA method's ability to rapidly generate and select the optimal movement speed and direction, drones can promptly navigate around obstacles, ensuring safe and smooth flight.
	
	Specifically, we anticipate that the DWA method will enable drones to perform well in scenarios with random obstacles and static environments. We expect drones to avoid obstacles and find the optimal path while maintaining stable and smooth flight. Additionally, we anticipate that the DWA method will have higher computational efficiency while ensuring flight safety, allowing for rapid execution under real-time requirements.
	
	In summary, we expect that by utilizing the DWA method, drones will be able to avoid obstacles and proceed steadily towards their destination, thereby improving the operational efficiency and safety of drones in practical applications, and promoting the widespread adoption of drone technology across various fields.
